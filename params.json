This is an attempt to use machine learning combined with image processing in order to make camera intelligent so that they can notify on detecting an anomalous behaviour. An anomalous behaviour, herein, is defined as an activity that seldom occurs in the camera's view for example, an accident on a highway. It uses WebCamFeed Extractor tool as a data acquisition software that extracts video feed from one of the public cameras at Iowa State University and saves it as a video. \r\n\t\r\nWebCamFeed Extractor\r\n----------------------\r\n\tThis tool extracts video feed from one of the public cameras at Iowa State University and is the data acquisition software for the project.\r\n\t\r\nTeam\r\n----------------------\r\n\tAbhineet Sharma( abhineet@iastate.edu ), Pursuing MS in Computer Science @ Iowa State University\r\n\tSayanatani Ghosh ( ghosh@iastate.edu ), Pursuing PhD in Computer Science @ Iowa State University\r\n\r\nDuration\r\n----------------------\r\n\tApprox 1 Month","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
